# craft

mkr/craft was the original server hosted originally in early 2019 and taken down in a few weeks. A new server was started in its name in April 2020 and is in its season 2 since December 2021.

## Rules:

The rules are guidelines and may be expanded by admins if needed at any time. In case of dispute, ping `@MKRhere` on the Telegram chat. Not following rules may cause me to ban you from the server. I expect you to behave without intervention, since the server is hosted on good will. Have fun and let others have fun too.

### `1)` Spawn regions

- `a)` "Spawn regions" cover current and previous world spawns. Each is a square area 700 blocks in x and z directions (1400x1400 blocks) centered on the each of:
	- `i.` Season 1: 0, 0
	- `ii.` Season 2: 460, -9608

- `b)` Spawn regions are reserved for newbies and as a common region for all players. No player may permanently settle here. New players are allowed to cut trees, mine, and gather resources before they begin their journey outwards. Otherwise, spawn regions are treated as No Man's Land.

- `c)` OPs may undertake projects in spawn regions to improve quality of life for all players, but may not settle in spawn regions themselves either.

### `2)` Play style

- `a)` This server is on normal difficulty, and encourages building and exploring. Since season 2, mkr/craft is also partially a content server, with related lore.

- `b)` While not a strict requirement, it's suggested to follow the server theme and build medieval/fantasy style buildings, castles, and so on. I appreciate if you follow biome and server theme.

- `c)` No hacks! Any mods that give you an unfair advantage is a hack. If you use a minimap mod, disable entity/mob radar. Duping, flyhacks, breaking bedrock, nether ceiling, and other hacks and glitches are disallowed.

- `d)` A server-wide map is made available publicly, but this is only for convenience. Map will automatically update often, so no need to ask unless there's a problem. After a version update, map may stop updating for a few weeks until the tech catches up.

- `e)` AFKing is not allowed. The server will kick you if you AFK for 5 minutes. Counter-measures are prohibited.

- `f)` Building automated farms is fine as long as it's server-friendly, in that it does not cause server lag. In case your contraption is killing the server, remove it yourself, or an OP will.

### `3)` Player bases

- `a)` Do not grief, obviously. If a region shows signs of having been occupied, don't damage or steal items. People spent time building stuff, so be respectful. You may only loot structures and villages not occupied by another player. The map shows permanently occupied bases, but may not be exhaustive.

- `b)` You can challenge, deal with, or otherwise trade territory with other players as you please, as long as any agreement is mutual. Individuals or factions may fight over occupied land if they both agree to terms. You may not fight players in their base without mutual agreement.

- `c)` Server does not monitor fighting in unoccupied territory.

On the whole, enjoy playing and use common sense :)
